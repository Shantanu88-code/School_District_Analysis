# School_District_Analysis

# Overview of analysis

In this analysis, we are helping Maria to provide insights on several schools' performance trends and patterns in a district. We analyse fundings for different schools
and student performances. We have also been given data on two subjects i.e. Math and Reading. We analyse students' grades in each school and overall school performance. All these insights will help in making strategic decisions on school and district level. Additionally, the school board informs about academic dishonesty at a particular school. To uphold testing standards, school board asked to conduct another analysis where we ommitted Math and Reading scores for 9th graders. With modifications, we look at the outcome of overall analysis and and its implications.
